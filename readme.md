# Python Algorithms

## Overview
Across years 11 and 12, during both my GCSE and A-Level computer science lessons, we were challenged to write the algorithms we'd just learned about in Python. In total, a mix of 9 algorithms and data structures were implemented across the two years. I've categorised them as follows:

### Graphs & Trees
During our graphs and trees topic in year 12, we we're tasked to implement a few of the more popular graph-based algorithms in Python. [Dikjstras.py](https://github.com/SamLolo/Algorithms/blob/main/Graphs%20%26%20Trees/Dikjstras.py) implements Dikjstras Algorithm, which finds the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph. The graph given was stored in a dictionary format, and was weighted and undirected. We also had to implement both Depth-first and Breadth-first traversal. For this, I used classes for each type of traversal, and I also re-used the queue and stack structures I'd made a few weeks prior.

### Sorting & Searching
These we're the first proper algorithms I wrote in Python, as part of a timed challenge in year 11. They covered the 4 most common sorting and searching algorithms: Linear Search; Binary Search; Bubble Sort & Merge Sort. While not originally implemented as functions, they could be easily converted and used in other projects.

### Stacks & Queues
These we're created during our topic on data structures in year 12. They are implemented using classes, with protected attributes, and functions to add/retrieve data stored within the structures. RPN stands for Reverse Polish Notation, which was covered alongside our data structures lessons. [RPN.py](https://github.com/SamLolo/Algorithms/blob/main/Stacks%20%26%20Queues/RPN.py) uses a stack to store and execute a range of reverse polish notation expressions.
